This chapter discusses the concept of budget constraints and how consumers allocate their limited income. It introduces the idea of opportunity cost, which is the value of the next best alternative given up when making a decision. The chapter also explains the law of diminishing marginal utility, which states that the additional satisfaction gained from consuming more of a good decreases over time. It further emphasizes the importance of marginal analysis in decision-making, the concept of sunk costs, and how these principles apply in a multi-good model.
