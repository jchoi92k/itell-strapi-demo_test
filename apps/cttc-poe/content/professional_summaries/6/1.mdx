This page discusses how to measure the size of an economy through Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a year. GDP can be measured by the total dollar value of what consumers purchase or what the country produces. The chapter also explains the components of GDP, which include consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Other concepts discussed include the national income approach to measuring GDP, the problem of double counting, and other ways to measure the economy such as Gross National Product (GNP) and Net National Product (NNP).
