## Values, Types, and Operators \{#Values,-Types,-and-Operators-761t}
Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below.

In the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.

_Bits_ are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Inside the computer, they take forms such as a high or low electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, or a shiny or dull spot on the surface of a CD. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

For example, we can express the number 13 in bits. This works the same way as a decimal number, but instead of 10 different digits, we have only 2, and the weight of each increases by a factor of 2 from right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number 13, with the weights of the digits shown below them:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
|128| 64| 32| 16|  8|  4|  2|  1|


That’s the binary number 00001101. Its nonzero digits stand for 8, 4, and 1, and add up to 13.

## Values \{#Values-762t}
Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has more than 100 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory). Nonvolatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude more.

To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called _values_. Though all values are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on.

To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is convenient. You don’t have to gather building material for your values or pay for them. You just call for one, and _whoosh_, you have it. Of course, values are not really created from thin air. Each one has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic number of them at the same time, you might run out of computer memory. Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of values.

The remainder of this chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs, that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values.

## Numbers \{#Numbers-764t}
Values of the _number_ type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a JavaScript program, they are written as follows:

```javascript
13
```

Using that in a program will cause the bit pattern for the number 13 to come into existence inside the computer’s memory.

JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, 64 of them, to store a single number value. There are only so many patterns you can make with 64 bits, which limits the number of different numbers that can be represented. With _N_ decimal digits, you can represent 10N numbers. Similarly, given 64 binary digits, you can represent 264 different numbers, which is about 18 quintillion (an 18 with 18 zeros after it). That’s a lot.

Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to accidentally _overflow_ such small numbers—to end up with a number that did not fit into the given number of bits. Today, even computers that fit in your pocket have plenty of memory, so you are free to use 64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.

Not all whole numbers less than 18 quintillion fit in a JavaScript number, though. Those bits also store negative numbers, so one bit indicates the sign of the number. A bigger issue is representing nonwhole numbers. To do this, some of the bits are used to store the position of the decimal point. The actual maximum whole number that can be stored is more in the range of 9 quadrillion (15 zeros)—which is still pleasantly huge.

Fractional numbers are written using a dot:

```javascript
9.81
```

For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by adding an _e_ (for _exponent_), followed by the exponent of the number.

```javascript
2.998e8
```

That's 2.998 x 10^8 = 299,800,000.

Calculations with whole numbers (also called _integers_) that are smaller than the aforementioned 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations with fractional numbers are generally not. Just as π (pi) cannot be precisely expressed by a finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them. This is a shame, but it causes practical problems only in specific situations. The important thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as approximations, not as precise values.

## Arithmetic \{#Arithmetic-763t}
The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce a new number from them. Here is what they look like in JavaScript:

<Sandbox>
100 + 4 * 11;
</Sandbox>

The `+` and `*` symbols are called _operators_. The first stands for addition and the second stands for multiplication. Putting an operator between two values will apply it to those values and produce a new value.

Does this example mean “Add 4 and 100, and multiply the result by 11”, or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might have guessed, the multiplication happens first. As in mathematics, you can change this by wrapping the addition in parentheses.

<Sandbox>
(100 + 4) * 11
</Sandbox>

**example of setting the height for the sandbox**

<Sandbox height={150} >
console.log(typeof 4.5)
// → number
console.log(typeof "x")
// → string
</Sandbox>
