The section discusses economic convergence, the phenomenon where low-income economies grow faster than high-income ones. It presents arguments for and against convergence, including the law of diminishing returns and the potential for low-income countries to adopt existing technologies. However, it also highlights that convergence is not inevitable, as high-income countries can continue to grow by developing new technologies. The section concludes that while convergence is possible, it will be a slow process due to the significant existing wealth gap. It also emphasizes the role of supportive economic, educational, and public policy institutions in facilitating economic growth.
