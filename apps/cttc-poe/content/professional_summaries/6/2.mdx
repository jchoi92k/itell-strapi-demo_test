This section of the textbook explains the difference between nominal and real GDP, and how to adjust nominal values to real values. Nominal GDP is the economic output measured at current market prices, while real GDP adjusts this output for inflation. The GDP deflator is used to calculate real GDP, which is a more accurate measure of economic growth. The text also explains the concept of a base year, which is the year used for comparison in real GDP calculations. It illustrates these concepts with examples of U.S. GDP from 1960 to 2010.
