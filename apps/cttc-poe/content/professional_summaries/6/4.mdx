This section of the textbook discusses how Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used to compare the economic welfare of different nations. It explains that to compare GDP between countries, it must be converted to a common currency using exchange rates. Additionally, because countries have different population sizes, GDP per capita (GDP divided by population) is used to compare standards of living. The text also provides examples of how to calculate these figures and discusses the differences in GDP and GDP per capita among various countries.
