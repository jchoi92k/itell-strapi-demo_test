The page discusses labor productivity and economic growth. Labor productivity, defined as the value each worker creates per unit of input, is crucial for economic growth. The determinants of labor productivity include human capital, technological change, and economies of scale. Economists measure economic growth using the aggregate production function, which shows the relationship between inputs and outputs in an economy.
