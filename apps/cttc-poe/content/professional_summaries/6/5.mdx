The page discusses the limitations of GDP as a measure of a society's well-being. It explains that while GDP per capita can indicate the standard of living, it does not account for factors such as leisure time, environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. It also does not consider production that is not exchanged in the market or the level of inequality in society. The text suggests that GDP is a rough but useful measure of standard of living, and that a higher GDP usually coincides with improvements in areas like education, health, and environmental protection.
